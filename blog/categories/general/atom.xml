<!-- more -->


<p>Well, as advertised, I attempted to recreate this blog post using Octopress (OP) in an attempt to compare the two blogging experiences. Initially, after reviewing my notes, the process seemed straight-forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a rake-task that generates a new post (and all the trappings that accompany it).</li>
<li>Copy this post into the markdown file</li>
<li>Run a rake-task to generate the necessary files. Here you can run a rake-task to preview the site locally.</li>
<li>Run a rake-task to push to GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>Commit all the new changes to GitHub &amp; push to my branch.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ul>


<p>I nailed the first two steps. I mean, totally nailed it -__- . What proceed to unfold was a journey through StackOverflow, scouring the Octopress docs, and blindly shredding my local repo with <code>git merges</code>, <code>reset --hard HEAD</code>&rsquo;s and the like. The issue was that I performed step 5 after step 2. It&rsquo;s that easy. Let me be clear; I screwed it up. Octopress had nothing to do with it. It really is simple and in many ways superior to WordPress (WP), but I&rsquo;m an idiot and can&rsquo;t follow directions very well.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>All in all, I really do enjoy the Octopress experience. I love interacting with my computer with the command-line and I love writing in Sublime Text 3. I think I need some more practice with Octopress so I&rsquo;m going to go with that format for now. Case closed.</p>

<p><strong> Original Post </strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out exactly which platform suits me best, WordPress (WP) or GitHub Pages (GP).</p>

<p>WP is so easy to crank out a quick post and there&rsquo;s tons of 3rd party support/widgets/plugins. It satisfies the &ldquo;I should blog more but I don&rsquo;t have anything to say really&hellip;but I&rsquo;m going to write a quick post anyways&rdquo; side of me. Disclaimer: this post is of the aforementioned variety :)</p>

<p>GP satisfies the neck-beard/control-freak side of me that wants to do everything his damn self even if it winds up taking twice as long (at least the first few times&hellip;).</p>

<p>With GP, writing a post feels more like writing a piece of code. Everything is composed locally (so I get to use my favorite editor, Sublime Text 3) and pushed to GitHub for publication. Plus, its interpretation of Markdown is really convenient when the topic is something technical and I want to include some code related to the project. The downside to using GP is that since I&rsquo;m such an infrequent blogger, I&rsquo;ve always got to check my notes to remember the workflow of how to create a new post and where to push and to which repo and so on and so forth. But that&rsquo;s not really even a problem with GP, that&rsquo;s a result of me not blogging enough! As a lazy person, WP is very tempting. You just visit your dashboard and start typing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering using them both: WP as more of a dairy for quick posts covering a broader range of topics, with GP mainly being used for updates on my technical projects. Best of both worlds&hellip;but it seems&hellip;unnecessary.</p>

<p>I know, I&rsquo;ll create this same exact post in GP. Then I&rsquo;ll write a follow-up post and compare and contrast the two further.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post using Octopress. I&rsquo;m still trying to get the hang of it, <em>and</em> I don&rsquo;t know markup well enough at the moment. So, let&rsquo;s give it a test-run.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I chose Octopress because it offers some handy plugins and its use of Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). So, let&rsquo;s test it out.</p>

<h2>Headers</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with something easy.</p>

<h1>h1 - This is quite large</h1>

<h2>h2 - I think I like this one the best</h2>

<h3>h3 - Blah blah blah</h3>

<h4>h4 - Getting smaller now&hellip;</h4>

<h5>h5 - Almost gone&hellip;</h5>

<h6>h6 - And the grand finale</h6>

<p>It appears that the h2 header is preceeded by a nice section break, which I like.</p>

<h2>Emphasis</h2>

<p>OK, what about <em>emphasis</em> and <em>underscores</em>? Or maybe <strong>strong emphasis</strong>? What about <strong><em>combined emphasis</em></strong>? I know, cool <del>story, bro</del>.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make a list of things I&rsquo;d rather do that listen to Contemporary Christian music:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get castrated using a butter-knife.</li>
<li>Just about anything, including:</li>
<li>first item in unordered sub-list  <em>(this is supposed to be a ul li, but it won&rsquo;t work -___-)</em>

<ul>
<li>second item in unordered sub-list</li>
<li>this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working at all</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h2>Links</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com">I&rsquo;m an inlike-style link</a><br>
<a href="http://www.google.com" title="See, I told you.">I&rsquo;m an inlike-style link with a title; hover over me!</a></p>

<h2>Images</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jx8SJmu.jpg" title="lolerskates" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2>Code and Syntax Highlighting</h2>

<p>Inline code is done with a single backtick: <code>ls -la | grep deeznutz</code>.  A single line of code can be instantiated by indenting a line with 4 spaces.</p>

<pre><code>String myString = "I'm not used to using markdown and stuff. Note that I don't have syntax highighting :("
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use three backticks, which will also gives you line numbering and syntax highlighting.</p>

<pre><code class="">$ git clone https://github.com/kbarre123/kbarre123.github.io.git
</code></pre>

<p>Larger code blocks are also fenced in with three backticks.</p>

<pre><code class="java Here's some Java code http://www.google.com Link">String myString = "Here's another string."
if (myString.length() &gt; 0)
{
    System.out.printf("%s%n", myString);
}
</code></pre>

<!--## Tables
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell -->


<h2>Blockquotes</h2>

<blockquote><p>This is a blockquote.<br/>
This is part of the same blockquote b/c I used two spaces after the first line.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>Three or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores will do.</p>

<h2>YouTube Videos</h2>

<p>These can&rsquo;t be added directly, but you can add an image with a link to the video like this:<br/>
