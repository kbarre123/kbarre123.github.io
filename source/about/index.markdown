My name is K.C. Barrett. I'm currently studying computer science at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. My interests include programming, 3D printing, making stuff move with microcontrollers, brewing beer and, well, drinking beer. I have a particular interest in how technology can assist the disabled.
