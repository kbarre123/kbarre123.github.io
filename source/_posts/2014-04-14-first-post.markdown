This is my first post using Octopress. I'm still trying to get the hang of it, *and* I don't know markup well enough at the moment. So, let's give it a test-run.
<!-- more -->

I chose Octopress because it offers some handy plugins. The one I forsee using the most is the inline code snippets.

    String myString = "I'm not used to using markdown and stuff."

There, that was easy. Now, let's try adding headers:

# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

Now that we know how to use headers, let's put them to good use.

## Emphasis
OK, what about *emphasis*? And _underscores_? Or **strong emphasis**? Or **_combined emphasis_**? I know, cool ~~story, bro~~.

## Lists

Let's make a list of things I'd rather do that listen to Contemporary Christian music:

1. Get castrated using a butter-knife.
2. Just about anything, including:
* first item in unordered sub-list  _(this is supposed to be a ul li, but it won't work -\_\_\_-)_
  * second item in unordered sub-list
  * this doesn't seem to be working at all
