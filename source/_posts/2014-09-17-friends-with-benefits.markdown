Well, it's been a while since my last post. Five months and three days to be exact. A lot has happened since then, so allow me to briefly recap.
<!-- more -->

After ending the Spring '14 semester with a bang (straight A's, ya'll) I flew to New Hampshire to visit my good friend, Blake Amacker. Blake's a mechanical engineer by day; aspiring distillery-magnate by night. I flew up for a month to help with the construction of the building, website design for the budding business, and general debauchery. We had an absolute blast and pretty much stayed drunk the entire time he wasn't at work. Keep an eye out for [Copper Cannon Distillery](http://www.coppercannon.com).
