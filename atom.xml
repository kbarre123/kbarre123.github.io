    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ubuntu is great, but their Software Center doesn&rsquo;t always offer the most up-to-date builds. Here&rsquo;s step-by-step instructions on building the Arduino IDE from source and adding it to the Applications menu for easy launching.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The convenience of installing software through the Ubuntu Software Center is that you&rsquo;ll receive updates via <code>$ sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade</code>, along with the fact that all of the behind-the-scenes work of adding the program to your system&rsquo;s menu is handled for you. The down-side is, at the time of publication, the version of the Arduino IDE offered by the Software Center was 1.0.5+dfsg2-2. That bad-boy was last updated January 8, 2014, which is about 14 months and 20 releases ago. Granted, I&rsquo;ve been using that build since it came out and have never had any issues with it at all, but it was time for an upgrade to the latest and greatest.</p>

<h2>Step #1</h2>

<p>Check and see which version the Ubuntu Software Center is currently offering. If its something you can live with, install it through the Software Center and move on with your life. If its not the one you want, proceed to step #2.</p>

<p>Here we see that they&rsquo;re still offering the incredibly old <code>Version: 1:1.0.5+dfsg2-2</code>, so we&rsquo;ll move on to step #2.</p>

<h2>Step #2</h2>

<p>Find the source files for the version that you <em>do</em> want. The current Arduino IDE source files can be found on their <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">homepage</a>. <em>Sidebar: there&rsquo;s recently been a rift amongst the founders of the Arduino organization. Be sure you&rsquo;re on the &lsquo;.cc&rsquo; domain and not the &lsquo;.org&rsquo;.</em> Based on your system&rsquo;s architecture, download the appropriate file (e.g. 32 vs 64 bit).</p>

<h2>Step #3</h2>

<p>Assuming that you&rsquo;re already located in your <code>$HOME</code> directory, move the file you just downloaded (probably in <code>~/Downloads</code> :D) to your <code>$HOME</code> directory and extract it. <em>Don&rsquo;t forget to ditch the archive after you extract it, you won&rsquo;t be needing it any more.</em></p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Move the archive to your $HOME directory and extract it</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Step #4</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind <code>cd</code>-ing into the <code>~/arduino-1.6.1</code> directory and running <code>bash arduino</code> every time you want to launch the program, you can stop here. For those of you who are a little more lazy like myself, we&rsquo;ll next be creating an application launcher. <em>Note: I&rsquo;m currently using Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS with Gnome Flashback Metacity. The file locations may differ slightly depending on which distribution/desktop environment you&rsquo;re using&hellip;but you&rsquo;ll figure it out.</em></p>

<p>First, create the file <code>/usr/share/applications/arduino.desktop</code> and include the following information therein.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Contents of arduino.desktop file</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">Terminal</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step #5</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to make your new file executable, so&hellip;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Make arduino.desktop executable</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>kcb@ubuntu<span class="nv">$ </span>chmod +x arduino.desktop
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step #6</h2>

<p>Finally, you just need to check to see if the application launcher file is free from errors.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Check the validity of your new application launcher file</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>kcb@ubuntu<span class="nv">$ </span>desktop-file-validate /usr/share/applications/arduino.desktop
</span><span class='line'>kcb@ubuntu<span class="err">$</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If no errors are returned and you get back a ready command-prompt, you&rsquo;re in business.</p>

<h2>Done!</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. You should now be able to browse to <code>Applications/Programming/Arduino</code> from the panel up top and the Arduino IDE should fire right up. No longer are you bound to the crusty old releases in the Ubuntu Software Center!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update:</strong> I converted the graphs into <a href="http://plot.ly">Plot.ly</a> graphs and boy are they awesome!

<p>Brewing beer is a science, and scientists need accurate measurements. Enter the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor. Here, I take a look at exactly how accurate it is and how to apply it in the science of beer brewing.
I love to make stuff. My friend Matt and I have been making beer for the last 2 years. We&rsquo;ve tried a dozen or so recipes, and they all kinda call for the same procedures to be performed:</p>

<ul>
<li>soak your grains in hot water (~173°F) for an hour in a container (or &lsquo;mash tun&rsquo;)</li>
<li>drain that (now considered &lsquo;wort&rsquo;) off of the grains</li>
<li>boil the wort for an hour, adding certain hops at certain times to achieve certain flavors</li>
<li>cool it down and add certain yeast</li>
<li>let it sit for a few weeks</li>
<li>drink</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ul>


<p>We&rsquo;ve had, what I consider to be, considerable success. Even the worst beer we&rsquo;ve made is still better than (insert domestic swill brand name here). But this post isn&rsquo;t about making beer, it&rsquo;s about making our own tools to improve the process.</p>

<p><strong><strong> Our Needs Have Changed </strong></strong></p>

<p>As I said earlier, the past dozen or so recipes have called for the same actions. However, Matt found a recipe for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_Weisse">Berliner Weisse</a>, a light sour beer from Northern Germany dating back to around the 16th century. Having really enjoyed my exposure to it in the past, we decided that we&rsquo;d brew it on the next brew-day. The problem was, the way the wort is prepared for a Berliner Weisse is quite different from how one would prepare, say, an ale. See, you never really boil the wort. So, what was once &ldquo;Turn on the burner full blast until she&rsquo;s at a full roll!&rdquo; has become &ldquo;How in the hell are we going to keep 10 gallons of fluid an exact temperature using just a propane burner?&rdquo;. Enter the <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html">DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor</a>!</p>

<p><strong><strong> The Hardware </strong></strong></p>

<p>The DS18B20 (henceforth referred to as &lsquo;the sensor&rsquo;) can be purchased in a waterproof, 6&#8217; &lsquo;probe&rsquo; form factor, which is exactly what we needed. I planned on using this with an <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardMega">Arduino Mega</a> and a <a href="http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-3-2-tft-lcd-display-touch-panel-pcb-adapter-sd-slot-for-arduino-2560.html">TFT touch-screen display</a> so we could have our temp readings display on a little screen mounted on our brew-cabinet. The other cool thing is that the sensor conforms to the <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/comms/one-wire.html">1-Wire protocol</a>, which means that multiple sensors can be chained together on one data wire and only take up a single I/O port on the Arduino. So, I ordered two: one for the mash tun and another for the boil-pot. Once they came in the mail, I slapped together a <a href="https://github.com/kbarre123/Arduino/tree/master/Temperature/DS18B20">quick sketch</a> to test them out.</p>

<p><strong><strong> Analysis </strong></strong></p>

<p>After letting them do their thing for a few minutes, I noticed that one of the two always read slightly lower than the other. I swapped their position in the circuit and got the same results. I&rsquo;ll call the lower one &lsquo;Sensor B&rsquo;. Well, one of them has to be (more) right, but how to tell which one? So, I let them run for a couple of hours, logging their result to the Serial monitor. I then imported that data into <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/">LibreOffice Calc</a> and plotted their readings over time. This is what I came up with:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-06_sensor/ds18b20_sensor_variance_analysis.png' width='' height='' title='Figure 1: Ambient Temperature Readings'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 1: Ambient Temperature Readings</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I used this same data, but generated the first graph using Python and <a href="http://plot.ly">Plot.ly</a>. Can you tell the difference?</p>

<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~kbarre123/172/" target="_blank" title="DS18B20 Temp Sensor Data" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~kbarre123/172.png" alt="DS18B20 Temp Sensor Data" style="max-width: 100%;"  onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="kbarre123:172" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>


<p>As you can see from the first half of Fig. 1, the two sensors tracked each other most of the time. And my suspicions were confirmed: Sensor B is always &lsquo;colder&rsquo; than Sensor A. The second half of Fig. 1 shows the variance b/t the two. The variance average was 1.35°F during the flat parts of the graph, and varied ±1°F from that during the &lsquo;spikes&rsquo;. Another important thing that this graph shows us is, around 886 seconds, both temperatures spike upwards and the variance plumets to less than 0.5°F. This is when I was holding the two sensor ends together so I could wrap a bread-tie around them to ensure that they were close to each other and experiencing the same temperature fluctuations as best I could. This was a clear sign that I had to reperform the test again, but under &lsquo;real-life&rsquo; conditions&hellip;in some hot-ass liquid.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-06_sensor/hot_ass_liquid.JPG' width='' height='' title='Figure 2: Hot-Ass Liquid'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 2: Hot-Ass Liquid</span></span></p>

<p>I let the sensors run as the water heated, and kept them running for about 10 minutes after the water began to boil. Here&rsquo;s what I saw:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-06_sensor/ds18b20_sensor_variance_analysis_boil.png' width='' height='' title='Figure 3: Hot-Ass Liquid Temperature Readings'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 3: Hot-Ass Liquid Temperature Readings</span></span></p>

<p>We can see that, under much higher temperatures, the two probes still tend to trach each other nicely. They both level off around 212°F as we&rsquo;d expect. The maximum recorded for Probes A &amp; B were 215.6°F and 214.25°F respectively. Unforunately, the average difference is now 1.74°F, an increase of 0.39°F from the last experiment&rsquo;s average difference.</p>

<p><strong><strong> Conclusion </strong></strong></p>

<p>All in all, with an advertised operating range of -55°C to +125°C and an accuracy of ±0.5°C from -10°C to +85°C, its hard to say whether or not thse sensors are faulty. For the use-case for which they were purchased, 2°F variance isn&rsquo;t going to ruin anything. At $9.95 a pop, I guess the moral of the story is &ldquo;You get what you pay for&rdquo;. And it ain&rsquo;t all that bad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here&rsquo;s how I took an Arduino Uno, some FOSS software, and created a Winter Wonderland.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>For those of you who&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, the &ldquo;maker community&rdquo; has been flourishing over the last few years. At the heart of it all lies very small, very cheap microprocessors. These microprocessors generally have only a few KB of storage and memory. But what they lack in power they make up for in breadth of utility. With one of these gizmos, you can make almost anything. I put one to work flicking my Christmas lights off and on in sync with a few holiday classic tunes. Here&rsquo;s how I did it.</p>

<p><strong> The Main Ingredients </strong></p>

<p>One of the most popular is the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> family of microcontrollers. You can get the Uno model <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA1HE0JZ2520&amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC&amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleMKP-PC-_-pla-_-PDA+Accessories-_-9SIA1HE0JZ2520&amp;ds_e_ad_type=pla&amp;gclid=CjwKEAiA5qOlBRDAn8K5qen65joSJADRvlbqDbEa9RaG8xcDxN2AtF79BvTlBolGACgNEUksd_0qDhoCM1zw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">for less than $30</a> if you buy from a Chinese manufacturer. See, Arduino did us all a huge favor and released the plans on how to build their products under an open-source license. That means anyone is free to manufacture their product and sell it as their own. I&rsquo;ve got official Arduino boards and the Chinese &ldquo;knockoffs&rdquo; and they both work just fine. However, depending on which manufacturer you buy from, your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>This experiment benefited from yet another open-source project, the <a href="http://www.vixenlights.com/">Vixen Lights</a> software. While Vixen 3 is the current release (and actively maintained), Vixen 2 is still around and in use by some in the community. And yes, there is a community of dudes (I&rsquo;m assuming) who tinker around and spend gobs of money and time making their house the coolest on the block during Christmas time. I found <a href="http://doityourselfchristmas.com/forums/showthread.php?28571-Vixen-3-and-Arduino/page2">DIYXmas</a> forum and remain very grateful for the help those guys provided helping me get everything working.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve mentioned Arduino and Vixen, it&rsquo;s probably a good time to explain how they tie together and make the magic happen. Vixen serves as the &ldquo;brains&rdquo; of the operation, firing off neurons down to the Arduino, who acts as the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo;. Vixen sends serial data to the Arduino via USB, and the Arduino performs the instructions (which in our case is making lights go blinky blinky). Let&rsquo;s take a deeper look at what&rsquo;s going on, shall we?</p>

<p><strong> Software That&rsquo;s Free (As In Beer AND Freedom) </strong></p>

<p>Vixen (unfortunately) only runs on Windows. It also depends on a specific version of the .NET framework (which it&rsquo;ll probably have to download) as well as Java, so sit back and watch the LOTR trilogy whilst it downloads. Once installed and opened, you&rsquo;ll have to set up a &lsquo;display&rsquo;, which serves as a software representation of your actual light display. Each element of your display has to be mapped to a &lsquo;channel&rsquo; of the software. Think of an element as the smallest, stand-alone unit of your display (e.g. a tree wrapped with lights or each post on your front-porch). An element can be independently turned on and off, or grouped together in an arbitrary manner (e.g. if each bush is an element, you can group all bushes into a &lsquo;bushes&rsquo; group or group each post into a &lsquo;posts&rsquo; group).</p>

<p>First, import an mp3 into Vixen. It&rsquo;ll generate a waveform, giving you visual clues as to what&rsquo;s going on in the song. I also used <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> to analyze the mp3 and exported an XML file with the &ldquo;down-beats&rdquo; of the song (i.e. the first beat of the measure). After importing that file into Vixen, an overlay of those beat-marks are shown on the project time-line (see Figure 1 below; the yellow lines are from the Audacity file). This is all in an attempt to get the lights flashing at the right time.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-02_vixen/vixen_overview.PNG' width='' height='' title='Figure 1: Vixen project view'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 1: Vixen project view</span></span></p>

<p>Now that we know where the down-beats are, we can begin orchestrating our light show. This will require some creativity. I can&rsquo;t really explain WHAT to do, but I can tell you HOW to do it. In Figure 1, you&rsquo;ll note that the project is broken up into rows. Each row represents an element in the display. This is all set up in the configuration that I won&rsquo;t go into in this post. See those white boxes in Figure 1? As the &ldquo;head&rdquo; of the music player sweeps from left to right when you hit play, if there&rsquo;s a box underneath the head, that element gets turned on. You can see that my boxes (<em>ahem</em> roughly) line up with the yellow beat-marks. So every 50ms, Vixen says &ldquo;OK, Dormers 1-3, Roof, &amp; Bushes&hellip;you&rsquo;re ON!&rdquo;. The Arduino, waiting on the other end of the USB cord, interprets these instructions and flicks the Dormers 1-3, Roof, &amp; Bushes lights on. They&rsquo;ll stay on until Vixen tells the Arduino to turn them off in a later packet. Figure 2 shows how each element in the software is mapped to the Serial message. I had to play around to figure out which plug to use for each element, but once I got it I marked the cords with a Sharpie so I won&rsquo;t have to figure it out again next year.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re on the topic, here&rsquo;s the code that the Arduino is running. In short, it&rsquo;s listening for a Serial packet. Once received, it turns on/off each channel of lights. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Scott Shaver for all of the great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zparticle">videos</a> and code that got me interested in this whole project. OK, so that&rsquo;s a rough overview of the software side. Now, let&rsquo;s take a look at the hardware.</p>

<p><strong><em> Hardware </em></strong></p>

<p>The hardware components I used are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>A used electrical service box (like one you&rsquo;d find on a construction site; they&rsquo;re water-resistant).</li>
<li>An [Arduino Uno r3] or equivalent. As long as there&rsquo;s at least 16 digital I/O ports.</li>
<li>Two <a href="http://www.sainsmart.com/8-channel-5v-solid-state-relay-module-board-omron-ssr-4-pic-arm-avr-dsp-arduino.html">Sainsmart 8 channel 5V Solid State Relay</a> (SSR) boards. At the time of publication, these were listed as $28.59&hellip;I paid maybe half of that. Shop around.</li>
<li>5&#8217; of Romex wire and a bag of 3-way jumpers</li>
<li>16 indoor/outdoor extension cords</li>
<li>2&#8217; of 22 gage jumper wire to connect the Arduino to the SSR units.</li>
<li>A small screwdriver and a regular sized screwdriver (no soldering, yay!).</li>
<li>A piece of plexi-glass, some machine screws, and nylon risers</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><strong> The Box </strong></strong></p>

<p>I found an old, slightly rusty service box at my grandpa&rsquo;s house. I sanded the rust spots and spray-painted it to protect the metal. This would serve as the housing for the Arduino and the two 8 channel solid-state relays. Another benefit of using a service box is that there&rsquo;s a plate on the front that, while easily removable, can still be screwed in place to prevent the unknowing from touching any of the dangerous parts inside.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-02_vixen/box_3.jpg' width='' height='' title='Figure 3: Housing'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 3: Housing</span></span></p>

<p><strong><strong> The Arduino </strong></strong></p>

<p>Again, I used an Arduino Uno R3, but any microcontroller with at least 16 digital I/O pins will suffice. Once the code from above has been loaded, Vixen is able to send Serial data to it. As packets come in, the Arduino responds accordingly, flipping it&rsquo;s little 5V pins off and on (hopefully in sync with your song). &ldquo;But, how are you able to power 110V indoor/outdoor Christmas lights when the Arduino can only push 5V out?&rdquo;, you ask? Well, that&rsquo;s where the SSR&rsquo;s come in to play.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-02_vixen/box_2.jpg' width='' height='' title='Figure 4: Wiring'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 4: Wiring</span></span></p>

<p><strong><strong> The SSRs </strong></strong></p>

<p>In Figure 3, you&rsquo;ll notice that the extension cords and 110V supply (orange extension cord) enter the box through the ports on the right. In Figure 4, you can see them running behind the SSRs and that there&rsquo;s 3 brass screws at the top and bottom of the picture. Those screws (along with nylon risers) support the plexi-glass to which the Arduino and SSRs are mounted (they themselves on risers to allow for cooling), giving the extension cords room to run to the top of the box and tie in to the power-supply-bar (where the incoming 110V supply is distributed amongst all 16 channels that feed the lights). As you can see, there are 8 channels on each board. The sides closest to the Arduino are connected, with 22 gage wire, to the digital I/O pins of the Arduino. The sides closes to the outside edge of the photo are connected to 110V with Romex wire and orange 3-way jumpers.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind with these SSRs is that each channel has an max amperage that you can run through it (this  model is 2mA I believe). At the most, I&rsquo;ve been able to chain 6 strands of lights together without blowing one of the relays. I know this because I&rsquo;ve blown one out by running 7 strands chained together off of one channel. Each strand should have a silver/gold tag near one of the plugs that denotes the total amps for that strand (somewhere in the ballpark of 0.34mA). So, 6 x 0.34mA = 2.04mA, <em>just</em> over the 2mA specs of the relay.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-02_vixen/box_1.jpg' width='' height='' title='Figure 5: Overview of Box'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 5: Overview of Box</span></span></p>

<p><strong><strong> The Whole Shebang-a-bang </strong></strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, what&rsquo;s happening here is as the Arduino receives instructions from Vixen, it turns its 16 digital I/O pins either on or off (as determined by your choreographed light sequence in the Vixen software). If a pin is turned on, 5V flows from the Arduino through those multicolored wires to the SSR board, flipping an internal switch in the relay that&rsquo;s powerful enough to connect the two sides of the 110V circuit. Then your lights come on outside your house. The Arduino does this 16 times every 50ms. That&rsquo;s pretty damn impressive for a $15 piece of hardware if you ask me.</p>

<p><strong><strong> Results </strong></strong></p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='http://kbarre123.github.io/images/2015-01-02_vixen/house_lights.jpg' width='' height='' title='Figure 6: Finished Product'><span class='caption-text'>Figure 6: Finished Product</span></span></p>

<p>All in all, it took me about 15 hours to stumble my way through the assembly of the box (I spent maybe $60 max), configure the software, write the Arduino sketch and throw together 4 choreographed sequences for a show that lasts around 10 minutes. I also ran two book-shelf speakers to the front porch, went out from the headphones port on my PC to a 100W receiver and cranked up the volume. Another great feature of Vixen is that you can schedule your shows so as long as the PC and stereo are on, you can set it and forget it. I had mine play every night from 5:00 - 9:30, starting every minutes. In between shows, I played a &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; sequence that just turned the lights on randomly but no music.</p>

<p>Check out my repositories on Github for further details on the software if you need some guidance (links in the right-hand aside of the page). Happy making!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A comparision of WordPress and Octopress as seen my a moron.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Well, as advertised, I attempted to recreate this blog post using Octopress (OP) in an attempt to compare the two blogging experiences. Initially, after reviewing my notes, the process seemed straight-forward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a rake-task that generates a new post (and all the trappings that accompany it).</li>
<li>Copy this post into the markdown file</li>
<li>Run a rake-task to generate the necessary files. Here you can run a rake-task to preview the site locally.</li>
<li>Run a rake-task to push to GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>Commit all the new changes to GitHub &amp; push to my branch.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ul>


<p>I nailed the first two steps. I mean, totally nailed it -__- . What proceed to unfold was a journey through StackOverflow, scouring the Octopress docs, and blindly shredding my local repo with <code>git merges</code>, <code>reset --hard HEAD</code>&rsquo;s and the like. The issue was that I performed step 5 after step 2. It&rsquo;s that easy. Let me be clear; I screwed it up. Octopress had nothing to do with it. It really is simple and in many ways superior to WordPress (WP), but I&rsquo;m an idiot and can&rsquo;t follow directions very well.</p>

<p><strong> Conclusion </strong></p>

<p>All in all, I really do enjoy the Octopress experience. I love interacting with my computer with the command-line and I love writing in Sublime Text 3. I think I need some more practice with Octopress so I&rsquo;m going to go with that format for now. Case closed.</p>

<p><strong> Original Post </strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to figure out exactly which platform suits me best, WordPress (WP) or GitHub Pages (GP).</p>

<p>WP is so easy to crank out a quick post and there&rsquo;s tons of 3rd party support/widgets/plugins. It satisfies the &ldquo;I should blog more but I don&rsquo;t have anything to say really&hellip;but I&rsquo;m going to write a quick post anyways&rdquo; side of me. Disclaimer: this post is of the aforementioned variety :)</p>

<p>GP satisfies the neck-beard/control-freak side of me that wants to do everything his damn self even if it winds up taking twice as long (at least the first few times&hellip;).</p>

<p>With GP, writing a post feels more like writing a piece of code. Everything is composed locally (so I get to use my favorite editor, Sublime Text 3) and pushed to GitHub for publication. Plus, its interpretation of Markdown is really convenient when the topic is something technical and I want to include some code related to the project. The downside to using GP is that since I&rsquo;m such an infrequent blogger, I&rsquo;ve always got to check my notes to remember the workflow of how to create a new post and where to push and to which repo and so on and so forth. But that&rsquo;s not really even a problem with GP, that&rsquo;s a result of me not blogging enough! As a lazy person, WP is very tempting. You just visit your dashboard and start typing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering using them both: WP as more of a dairy for quick posts covering a broader range of topics, with GP mainly being used for updates on my technical projects. Best of both worlds&hellip;but it seems&hellip;unnecessary.</p>

<p>I know, I&rsquo;ll create this same exact post in GP. Then I&rsquo;ll write a follow-up post and compare and contrast the two further.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post using Octopress. I&rsquo;m still trying to get the hang of it, <em>and</em> I don&rsquo;t know markup well enough at the moment. So, let&rsquo;s give it a test-run.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I chose Octopress because it offers some handy plugins and its use of Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). So, let&rsquo;s test it out.</p>

<h2>Headers</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with something easy.</p>

<h1>h1 - This is quite large</h1>

<h2>h2 - I think I like this one the best</h2>

<h3>h3 - Blah blah blah</h3>

<h4>h4 - Getting smaller now&hellip;</h4>

<h5>h5 - Almost gone&hellip;</h5>

<h6>h6 - And the grand finale</h6>

<p>It appears that the h2 header is preceeded by a nice section break, which I like.</p>

<h2>Emphasis</h2>

<p>OK, what about <em>emphasis</em> and <em>underscores</em>? Or maybe <strong>strong emphasis</strong>? What about <strong><em>combined emphasis</em></strong>? I know, cool <del>story, bro</del>.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s make a list of things I&rsquo;d rather do that listen to Contemporary Christian music:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get castrated using a butter-knife.</li>
<li>Just about anything, including:</li>
<li>first item in unordered sub-list  <em>(this is supposed to be a ul li, but it won&rsquo;t work -___-)</em>

<ul>
<li>second item in unordered sub-list</li>
<li>this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working at all</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code and Syntax Highlighting</h2>

<p>Inline code is done with a single backtick: <code>ls -la | grep deeznutz</code>.  A single line of code can be instantiated by indenting a line with 4 spaces.</p>

<pre><code>String myString = "I'm not used to using markdown and stuff. Note that I don't have syntax highighting :("
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can use three backticks, which will also gives you line numbering and syntax highlighting.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ git clone https://github.com/kbarre123/kbarre123.github.io.git</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Larger code blocks are also fenced in with three backticks.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Here&#8217;s some Java code</span><a href='http://www.google.com'>Link</a></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">myString</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Here&#39;s another string.&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">myString</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printf</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%s%n&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">myString</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<!--## Tables
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

<blockquote><p>This is a blockquote.<br/>
This is part of the same blockquote b/c I used two spaces after the first line.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Horizontal Rule</h2>

<p>Three or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores will do.</p>
